                                <h3>What is Axe Throwing?</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Axe throwing as an indoor competitive sport has taken off in Canada over the past decade and more recently in the United States since Urban Axes opened its doors as the first axe throwing facility in the country. Similar to darts, axe throwing is an individual sport played with and against other members of a group. Individuals throw ~1.5 lb. hatchets at wooden targets marked with a bullseye and score points based on where on the target they stick the axe.
                                </p>

                                <h3>How does it work?</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Typically a lane booked at Hatchet in Hand last 1-2 hours depending on group size and must be booked in advance. All events start with safety instructions and guidance from our fully trained coaches to get everyone throwing safely and comfortably in a private throwing area. Once you've sharpened your skills, we'll kick off a round robin tournament followed by final knockout round to award an axe-throwing champion. Your group will play a series of round robin tournaments and then a standard elimination tournament. At the end of every round robin tournament, one member of the group is the winner.
                                </p>

                                <hr />

                                <h3>Is it safe?</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Safety is our number one priority. The format we use and the construction of the throwing lanes are all focused around the safety of the participants. Each competitor throws in his/her own individual lane and competes side-by-side with another competitor. Our coaches will be nearby to ensure safety protocols are adhered to. Only the two active competitors throwing at that time are allowed within the throwing area, all other competitors are required to wait in the safety zone behind the lanes.
                                </p>

                                <hr/>

                                <h3>Do I need to book or can I just come in?</h3>
                                <p>
                                    We prefer booking online or in advance so we can have have your lane ready before you arrive ! Walk Ins are welcome but if the lanes are ful you might experience a light delay. You definitely need to book ahead for group events. We do offer walk-in throwing sessions throughout the week. Please check our schedule for availability. We are available for bookings 5 days a week, and also offer corporate event packages.
                                </p>

                                <hr />

                                <h3>What are the minimum age requirements?</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Hatchet in Hand is a 21+ facility. No one under the age of 21 is permitted entry. All guests must provide valid photo identification on entry to an Hatchet in Hand facility.
                                </p>

                                <hr />

                                <h3>What if more people want to come after I already booked my reservation?</h3>

                                <p>
                                    The group size range that you booked tells us how many throwing lanes your group needs. As long as your number of participants stays within your group range, you're good to go. Just make the extra payment for more personal at the front desk.
                                </p>

                                <hr />

                                <h3>What if I think I may go over my group booking size?</h3>
                                <p>
                                    If you've already booked but now another friend or neighbor (or your friend's neighbor!) want to join in as well (and who wouldn't?), and you think you're going to go over the range you booked, please contact the site you booked at ASAP (contact details are on your invoice!) and we can check availability to increase your reservation size. Please give us as much notice as possible though because we tend to sell out quickly and, if that happens, you'll just have to tell your friend's neighbor "no" and cap your reservation. Nobody wants that to happen!
                                </p>

                                <hr />

                                <h3>What if my estimate is in between two group sizes? Which size should I book? </h3>
                                <p>
                                    We always recommend booking the bigger size. It is much easier for us to decrease the booking size as you get closer to the date than it is to increase it if we have already filled up! Some days sell out early and then we cannot increase your group size, so you'll have to cap your group at less than you may have wanted to bring.
                                </p>

                                <hr />

                                <p>
                                    If your headcount falls below the minimum number of people for your booked group size, you MUST give us at least 48 hours notice to change your booking size or you will be obligated to pay for the minimum number of people in the originally booked group size.
                                </p>

                                <hr />

                                <h3>Can I really throw an axe? Really??</h3>
                                <p>
                                    You sure can! It has nothing to do with size or strength. And once you land your first bullseye, you'll be hooked!
                                </p>

                                <hr />

                                <h3>Will someone teach me how to do this?</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Of course! Our trained coaches will start with coaching to get everyone throwing safely and comfortably, and ensure safety protocols are followed.
                                </p>

                                <hr />

                                <h3>What if I don't have a group, how can I participate?</h3>
                                <p>
                                    We offer weekly walk-in sessions and Open Throwing sessions at various times, for individuals, couples or very small groups - please see the booking page for more details. You can also join one of our leagues! You don't need a group to join a league.
                                </p>

                                <hr />
                                <h3>Do I need experience to join a league?</h3>
                                <p>
                                    No experience is required! Our friendly league community prides itself on helping new throwers learn the ropes.
                                </p>

                                <hr />

                                <h3>Is there an age limit?</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Hatchet in Hand is a 21+ facility.  No one under the age of 21 is permitted entry.  All guests must provide valid photo identification on entry Hatchet in Hand facility.
                                </p>

                                <h3>What do I wear?</h3>
                                <p>
                                    The only real requirement is for closed-toe shoes, although it is helpful to have a shirt that allows you full range of motion for your arms. Other than that, it is pretty much up to you. If you want to wear a ball gown or your favorite track suit, do it up!
                                </p>

                                <hr />

                                <h3>Is there parking?</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Parking is available on the street, but a large parking area is located just behind the establishment with plenty of parking spaces at all times. However, please also consider alternative transport options such as taxis or ride-sharing services such as Uber, Lyft, etc. and drink responsibly!
                                </p>
                                <hr />

                                <h3>How do I pay?</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Full payment is expected at the time of booking. We only accept credit and debit card payments both online and at our facilities at this time. Cash payment is not available, nor do we accept checks. Guests can pay the balances they owe individually onsite at the time of event. Cancellations prior to 48 hours are eligible for a refund or one time reschedule. Cancellations within 48 hours (including day of) are non-refundable with a onetime reschedule allowance. No Exceptions.
                                </p>

                                <hr />

                                <h3>Do you allow spectators?</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Why spectate when you can participate? First time visitors often tell us "I didn't really want to throw, I just came because my friends were, but I'm so glad I did and had such a great time!". That said, if someone in your group is unable to throw, exceptions can be made. Please contact us if someone in your group cannot throw.
                                </p>

                                <hr />

                                <h3>Can we take pictures & videos?</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Definitely, you will want to remember your first bullseye. We'd also love for you to tag us on Instagram and Facebook #hatchetinhand
                                </p>

                                <h3>What about accessibility?</h3>
                                <p>
                                    We like character in our facilities, so we are generally in older warehouse-type buildings, but we make sure all of our facilities are fully ADA compliant with regards to access ramps, bathrooms and throwing facilities. Axe throwing is readily available for a wide range of people with different abilities.
